            <p> The heart of Home is it’s people. Our incredible customers and our amazing staff are what make Home special. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, we have already been forced to close one of our locations and reduce our hours at the other two locations. We have made the decision to still remain open just for to go orders, phone orders, and delivery apps. We have a whole team of amazing individuals who are counting on us to make a living, so we are doing our best to remain open for as long as we possibly can.  </p>
